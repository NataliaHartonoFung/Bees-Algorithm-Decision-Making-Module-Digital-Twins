# Bees-Algorithm-Decision-Making-Module-Digital-Twins
The repository contains MATLAB code and the results of the experiments for quality = 0.8, 0.9, and 1. 
This experiments build upon previous research: Kerin, M., Hartono, N. and Pham, D.T., 2023. Optimising remanufacturing decision-making using the bees algorithm in product digital twins. Scientific Reports, 13(1), p.701.
The results saved in mat file, contains 51x30 cell for each quality tested. Column = runs. The row = distance. The 1st row = 0 km, 2nd row = 100 km, 3rd row = 200 km, ... 51st row = 5000 km. BA = Bees Algorithm, BA2 = Two-parameters BA, BAF = Fibonacci BA. 
The code in MATLAB version 2020a.
